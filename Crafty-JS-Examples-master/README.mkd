[Crafty](http://craftyjs.com) API document is kind of light. The examples are just snippets which are not runnable. I created some stand-alone examples, so that uses can run any of them without the need to add additional code. Note that this is project in progress. Examples of only a small number of functions in Crafty have been created.

To view the examples, prepend path with <http://pengyu.github.com/Crafty-JS-Examples/>.

For example, to view <https://github.com/pengyu/Crafty-JS-Examples/blob/gh-pages/Crafty/Graphics/Color/main.html>, go to <http://pengyu.github.com/Crafty-JS-Examples/Crafty/Graphics/Color/main.html>.
